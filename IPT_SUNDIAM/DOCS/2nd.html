          <p>I was introduced to basketball at a young age. Growing up in Malabon town, I would watch Kobe Brayant with wide-eyed admiration, imagining myself making those buzzer-beaters and slam dunks. My first experience with the game was at school, where I played with friends.

At the time, I was just a kid with a dream, dribbling a ball that felt too big for my hands. But there was something magical about the sound of sneakers squeaking on the court and the rhythmic bounce of the ball. </p>
